# SmartPath - A Degree Planning tool

## Project Description
This project was created as coursework for our software engineering course. SmartPath was envisioned as a web app that allows students to plan their degree as well as share those plans with advisors and other users. Users can:
- Create an account & login for a regular user or advisor
- Create public and private plans that align with hard-coded majors
- View all plans as an advisor
- View their own plans

### Prequisites: 
- NodeJS and npm, which you can install from on Node's [website](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

## How to Run:
- In your terminal, run `node server.js` in the server directory and `npm start` in the inner smartpath directory.
- A browser window should open with the app, or you can navigate to [localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000).
